## What is analogueExtra?
**analogueExtra** is an R package providing extra functions and tools for use with my **analogue** package. This extra functionality contains things that most users of **analogue** won't need all the time. Hence I've included them here. Initially, this is restricted to the `plot3d` method for `prcurve()` objects as the **rgl** package can be a pain to install on Apple Macs (so I am told by users). In time I plan to add **ggplot2** versions of of some of the plots generated by **analogue** here too.
